# Revenue and Gross Profit Calculation
```markdown
To calculate the revenue and gross profit (loss) for each year using the percentage of completion method, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the percentage of completion for each year:**
   `Percentage of Completion = Cost incurred to date / Total estimated cost`

2. **Calculate the revenue to be recognized:**
   `Revenue to be recognized = Percentage of Completion × Total contract value`

3. **Calculate the gross profit (loss):**
   `Gross Profit (Loss) = Revenue to be recognized - Cost incurred to date`
```

## Explanation

1. ||Year 1|Year 2|
    |---|---|---|
    |Contract price|$ 4,000,000|$ 4,000,000|
    |Actual costs to date|800,000|3,100,000|
    |Estimated costs to complete|2,400,000|- 0 -|
    |Total estimated costs|3,200,000|3,100,000|
    |Gross profit (estimated in Year 1)|$ 800,000|$ 900,000|
    
    Revenue recognition:
    
    Year 1: $800,000 ÷ $3,200,000 = 25% × $4,000,000 = $1,000,000
    
    Year 2: $4,000,000 − $1,000,000 = $3,000,000
    
    Gross profit recognition:
    
    Year 1: $1,000,000 − $800,000 = $200,000
    
    Year 2: $3,000,000 − $2,300,000 = $700,000
    
    Note: We also can calculate gross profit directly using the percentage of completion:
    
    Year 1: $800,000 ÷ $3,200,000 = 25% × $800,000 = $200,000
    
    Year 2: $900,000 − $200,000 = $700,000
    
2. Year 1: $0 (contract not yet completed)
    
    Year 2: $4,000,000 − $3,100,000 = $900,000
    
3. Costs and profit ($1,000,000) in excess of billings ($850,000) = $150,000
    
    $1,000,000 = Costs ($800,000) + profit ($200,000)
    
4. Billings ($850,000) in excess of costs ($800,000) = $50,000
