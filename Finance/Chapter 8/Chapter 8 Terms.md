[[common stock]]
	- the number of shares of [[common stock]] owned by an investor determines their percentage of ownership in the company.
	*If* you buy a share of stock, you can make money from two sources:
		1. Payment of [[dividends]].
		2. Sell shares for more than you paid to buy them.
	The price of the stock is primarily based on the [[present value]] of these two expected [[cash flows]].
		*If* the [[dividend growth]] remains constant, the price of the stock is really just the [[present value]] of all expected future dividends.
			The R in the [[dividend growth model]] explains ones certainty and assessment of risk.
				The only way to not have risk is just to only buy U.S. Treasury Bills or Bonds
					This is shown as the [[required return formula]]
