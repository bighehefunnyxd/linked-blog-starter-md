Summary statistics describe the location, spread, shape, and dependence
of a set of observations. These commonly include the count, sum,
minimum, maximum, mean or average, standard deviation, median,
quartiles, correlation covariance, and frequency that describe a specific
measurable value.

The use of summary statistics helps the user understand what the data
look like. For example, the sum function can be used to determine account
balances. The mean and median can be used to aggregate transactions by
employee, location, or division. The standard deviation and frequency help
to identify normal behavior and trends in the data.
