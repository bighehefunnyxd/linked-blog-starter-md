[[Micro]] vs [[Macro]]: It is not a difference in content but in *Scope* Both are relative to the economy as a whole.

[[Macro Economics ]]is primarily public policy, proposals and analysis. This includes economic laws from the past (history), present (current policy), and future (policy proposals). There are two topics:
	1. Economic progress - standards of living/material wellbeing over time
	2. The business cycle - booms and busts, and what causes depressions, recessions, bull, bear, etc. markets. 
Topics of [[economic laws]]:
	**Q.** ***What is it?***
		*Features of a law:* 
			1. Regulates activity
			2. Universally applied
		*Categories of law:*
			1. Law of nature: *Scientific* such as gravity (predictive), and *statistical* such as genetics (probability).
				- Descriptive (Explains and describes past occurrences).
				- Starts with an observable fact.
				- Discovered by empirical hypothesis testing methods.
			2. Laws of human behavior: moral laws of human thought, [praxeological]([Praxeology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxeology)) laws of human behavior (praxis --> action, logia --> "study of").
				- Prescriptive (Explains and describes future occurrences).
				- Start with reflective facts (introspection).
				- Discovered by revelation and reason.
			3. Economic Laws
	**A**. [[economic laws]] are universal rules that regulate the economy, such as the law of demand or production, or one of the [[laws of utility]] or the [[law of returns]]. **They are laws that describe *physical change* in terms of money.** They are inherently nonprescriptive of a moral imperative (should buy because someone says so or else).
		Cause of economic laws:
			Some people discover and some copy, sometimes without understanding the reasoning or undergirding causes. 
		Economic laws are not merely empirical regularities
			- We know what the impact of a universal capital gains tax would be so we don't need to rely on trial and error.
				i.e. It would be detrimental to trade and production, i.e. human prosperity.
			- Economic *theory* is just an abstraction that simply tries to explain empirical evidence without having to try every possible situation for its solution.
				i.e. Just like the law of gravity doesn't describe what is happening to a ball that is dropped, it just explains it.
		- Descriptive.
		- Start with reflective facts (introspection).
		- Discovered through reason, due to the amount of factors involved (cant discover gravity through brute force because of air friction and other factors).
	**Q.** ***Who discovered them?***
		*Economist*: 
			"Someone who accepts "natural economic laws" exist. These laws don't need to be enforced by the government and assume that humans naturally engage in [[mutually beneficial]] activity."
				Almost nobody in the ancient world followed this definition because "empirical evidence testing" wasn't common.
					 - It was observed first around the middle ages through the ["scholastic movement"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism) through the "[[Christian concepts of human nature]]" (*Thomas Aquinas* in the 13th century).
		*Different past views of laws of human nature:*
			Pairs of extremes:
			1. Natural Law Framework for Inquiry:
				"God regulates what happens in the world by creating each thing with its own set of characteristics." (Opposed by God saying he HOLDS the world together for the good of those who love him)
			2. Natural Law by Decree: (*THE MOST PLAUSIBLE ONE*)
				"God doesn't physically push the earth with his finger, or set up a physical set of interactions by accident or by 'winding logic' it was all intentional by his decree." You can act in the play and trust Shakespeare. (*Coherent with the commandments of God*)
			1. Plotinus View:
				"God exists and everything is inside him"
				The natural laws ARE god, he pushes things with his finger, etc. (Opposed by God being pure and his creation being tainted with sin).
				i.e. Pantheism
			2. Newtonian Deism:
				"God wound up the world like a clock and let it run." (Opposed by God saying he HOLDS the world together).
	**A.** The First Economists:
		1. (Good tweeter) *Jean Buridan* 1295-1358ish AD:
			- Started with commentaries, specifically his "Questions" commentary on Aristotle's "Physics" manuscript.
			- First to hold a Natural Law Framework for claiming that exchange is mutually beneficial from a personal subjective level, even if the objective level of both items being traded is "unequal" by some measure.
		2. (First Full Writing) *Nicholas Oresme* 1323-1382ish AD: 
			- Treatise on the origin, nature, la, and alteration of money. (Handbook on debasement to his city-state prince).
				- Path of money shifted during debasement periods from areas of low gold to areas of high gold, so patterns of production changed. Early people took the real gold and left, while later people got destroyed, including the city state that debased.
		3. Spanish Scholastics of the 16th century
			- Showed that gold inflation is similar to debasement. The inflation of gold from the new world caused price inflation in Spain.
	Q. ***What distinguished it?***
		
Method and scope:
	*Science of economics:* (is it really a science?)
		(Dissimilar to a theory of historical science, which DOESN'T EXIST)
		- It has a body of laws to be discovered.
		- It has an accepted method to discover said laws.
		Are there qualitative laws of economics?
			- Short answer: Yes.
			- Long answer: there are theories, but quantitative laws are similar to physics where there's theoretical laws but the physical study is sometimes out of order.
		Are there quantitative laws of economics?
			No.
	*Praxeological Method of Economics:* 
		1. Discover facts about human action by using introspection (similar to C.S. Lewis' laws of morality).
		2. Deduce the logical implications from these reflective facts.
		3. Impose stipulations
